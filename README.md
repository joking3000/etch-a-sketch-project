## Etch-A-Sketch Project

This is a project I'm using to practice DOM manipulation with Javascript.
The goal is to create something between an Etch-A-Sketch and a sketchpad in the browser.
Desired learning outcomes are to become more proficient with Javascript in general and working with the DOM.
By the completion of the project, I will have demonstrated my ability to create a working Javascript program with a visual interface within the browser.

The original idea for this project comes from The Odin Project's [_**Curriculum**_](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)
